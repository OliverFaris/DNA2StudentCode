I do think while a linear search approach would be wildly inefficient, it would work. But what frightens me most is the special edge case where a certain string of bases might look like it has one str when it actually has two. I'm not totally sure how to overcome that case but I'm going to forget it exists until it bites me in the back later on. This also reminded me of how the command f shortcut works soo fast |

I know this isn't related to graph theory so I do wonder if this is a totally new way of seeing problems or something. I don't know. But to really solve this problem efficiently I need to brush away all the details and get to the core of the problem which is a searching algorithm and seeing if there are consecutive STRs. Maybe thats it? We come up with a better search algorithm somehow and then compare the indecies (how do you spell index but plural) to see when they repeat. But how to make the search algorithm faster, I have no idea so I'm sticking with linear search for now. |

I just need some variables to keep track of different things. That was kind of vague but I finished the algorithm and it doesn't really work for some reason. |

I fixed up the code and it does seem a little weird now but it works. I tried some ways to make it just a little more efficient but in reality I was probably just shaving off mere milliseconds. I wasn't making categorical improvements or anything, I would need a better algorithm for that. |

I completely understand the bug but I am very confused on how to avoid it. Right now I think kind of recursively where for every str you find, you check if there is an str in the index right after it and go on those two paths and see which is better? I think I explained it badly. I need a way to detect when that case happens first. Maybe after I find an str, I figure out if there is another right after. That could work but is inefficient. Going along with this I could split the problem up I guess. |
| October 17 | 12:00am-12:30am |        I have a feeling the answer to this bug is simpler than I think. Like in the snakes and ladders, I was stressing so much about all the different cases and stuff so here's what I think right now: Maybe the algorithm we use for this problem set will kind of fix the error on its own without any trouble. I think this because I think that the algorithm will work in a way that is so different and more unique than linear search that it doesn't follow the same rules as linear search. By the way, I never got my code to work for the tricky one, which has that edge case in it I think and also I didn't even try to test it on the chromosome 22 one since linear search and 51 mil nitrogenous bases doesn't seem like it would take a very short amount of time. Anyways I do wonder, how much of an improvement we can make from linear search. I think my algorithm is O(sequence length * amount of STRs) because I use indexOf each time I look for a new STR. |
